This is my third One Game A Month entry.
The March game will be a cute little Racer thingy (without CPUs).
I will implement a funny movement, then you have to navigate through various
parcours and try to get the best time.

This game is open source, go ahead and use the stuff as you like. It would
be nice if you mention my twitter/nickname hollowspecter :)

This game should be done in quite a short time, so I can work on my
bigger project, the April game.
